# React Quiz App

This React project was created while following lectures by [Max](https://github.com/academind). 

**Disclaimer:** This project is solely for educational purposes and is based on the lectures and project design by Max. I do not claim any ownership of the project's design, logic, or any other aspect. 

**Key Features:**

* **Component Management:** The application is well-structured with multiple, reusable components for better maintainability.
* **useEffect & useCallback Hooks:** The `useEffect` hook is used effectively for managing side effects like data fetching and subscriptions, while `useCallback` is employed to optimize component re-renders.
* **Component Splitting:** The application is divided into smaller, well-defined components, improving code organization and readability.
* **Prop Drilling:** Props are passed down through the component tree to share data and functionality between components.
* **Dynamic Styling:** CSS-in-JS or a similar approach is used to dynamically style components based on their state or props.
* **Results Display:** The application displays calculated results to the user dynamically based on user input and application logic.
